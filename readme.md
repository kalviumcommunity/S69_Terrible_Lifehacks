Project Title: List of Worst Life Hacks

Project Overview: The "List of Worst Life Hacks" is a web application that allows users to submit and vote on the most ridiculous and impractical "life hacks" they’ve encountered or invented. The site will serve as a humorous and community-driven platform where users can share and discover outrageous and often useless hacks that are intended to make life easier but, in reality, make things worse or simply don't work. The goal of this project is to demonstrate full-stack web development skills, including building an API, managing a database, creating a user-friendly frontend, and deploying a fully functional application.

Key Features: User Authentication: Allow users to sign up, log in, and manage their accounts securely. Life Hack Submission: Users can submit their own “worst life hacks” along with a short description and category (e.g., kitchen, cleaning, technology). Voting System: Users can vote on submitted hacks, marking them as "hilariously bad" or "even worse." Comments Section: Users can comment on hacks and interact with other community members. Dynamic List Display: Display a list of life hacks that updates in real-time based on user voting and new submissions. Categories: Organize hacks into categories (e.g., cleaning hacks, food hacks, tech hacks, etc.). Search Functionality: Allow users to search for specific life hacks or filter them based on categories or voting. Admin Dashboard: A simple admin panel to moderate submissions and delete inappropriate content.
